        <h2>Task Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> This task takes approximately 15-25 minutes. There are 320 trials. </p>
        <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> You will be compensated $2.00 for completing the hit.</p>
        <p><strong>Task:</strong> Identify the color of the center image as quickly as possible using the keyboard.</p>
        <p><strong>Preview:</strong> You can preview this hit by continuing without accepting the hit. </p>
        <p><em>To complete the hit you must accept the hit before continuing.</em> Close the practice window, then accept the hit on the main window to continue.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

        <p>On each trial three images will appear in either blue, green, red or yellow. Your task is to identify the color of the <strong>center</strong> image as quickly as possible using the keyboard.</p>
        <p> For example: </p>
        <p><img src="/images/339blue.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
            <img src="/images/339green.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
            <img src="/images/339blue.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
        </p>
        <p>You will press "b" if the center image is blue, "g" if the center image is green, "r" if the center image is red, and "y" if the center image is yellow.</p>
        <p>Once you make a response you will automatically proceed to the next trial.</p>
        <p>After every 80 trials you will receive a break screen. Feel free to take a short break.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Here is an example of an image presented in blue, green, red, and yellow:</p>
        <p><img src="/images/339blue.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
            <img src="/images/339green.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
            <img src="/images/339red.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
            <img src="/images/339yellow.jpg" height="155" width="155" />
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p>This experiment requires a pop-window to be full-screen. At the end of the experiment the window will automatically close and return you to amazon where you can submit the hit.</p>

            <h2><strong>Title:</strong> Cognitive processes in motor control</h2>
            <h2><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Dr. Matthew Crump - Psychology Department</h2>
            <hr>

            <h3>Purpose of the Research Study:</h3>
            <p>The research is being conducted to gain more knowledge about the cognitive processes involved in highly trained skills, such as typing, that require people to rapidly order actions in a goal-directed fashion.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Procedures:</h3>
            <p>The experiment will involve one session lasting approximately 15-25 minutes. The specific task may vary and could involved the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Perform typing tasks. Tasks involve being presented with a visual stimulus and making a typing response. The visual stimulus could be a word, a letter, a string of letters, or a picture. You will be required to make a response to the target by using the computer keyboard. Unless instructed otherwise please be as quick and accurate as possible when making responses.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 14"><strong><em>*Note that sometimes the backspace or delete key may not function during the task.</em></strong>
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <p>Although it will not directly benefit you, this study will advance basic science on the cognitive processes involved in motor control. This could lead to better training curriculum for improving skills like typing and playing musical instruments.</p>
            <hr>

                    <p>This document serves as short description of the purposes behind our experiment.</p>

                    <p>
                        You just completed what is commonly known as a Flanker task. On each trial you were presented with three images. Sometimes all three images were in the same color (congruent) and sometimes they were presented in different colors (incongruent). Typically people are slower to respond when the color of the center image is different from the flanking images demonstrating an inability to ignore the conflicting information. The current experiment investigated whether repeating specific images with either the same or different color configuration (congruent versus incongruent) would change this effect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are conducting this study to investigate these spatial aspects of human attention across a wide range of participants.
