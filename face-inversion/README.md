# face inversion

It has long been known that presenting a face upside-down can dramatically impair recognition.


However, Yin (1969) was the first to show that inverting the orientation of images impacts our recognition of faces far more than other mono-oriented objects (objects that we typically see in a single orientation). Since then, researchers have debated whether the face inversion effect reflects a "special" face process that is disrupted or a more general effect of learning and expertise.


This experiment demo is almost identical to Yin's experiment 1 (1969). However, here we're only comparing recognition of faces to houses. Additionally, in the original study Yin alternated between small study/test blocks. Here, you study all 96 images first, then complete the forced-choice recognition memory task where you're tested on all 96 images.


The face images come from the Chicago Face Database (Ma, Correll, & Wittenbrink 2015; faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/cfd/), while the house images come the Computational Vision Group (vision.caltech.edu/archive)
