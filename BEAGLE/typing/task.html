                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two parts to this experiment. In the first, you will have type a word as quickly and as accurately as possible (instructions for the second will be given once you've completed the first).
                    </p>
                    <p> On every trial you'll see two words presented briefly, one after the other. Your task is to type the <strong>second</strong> word as quickly and as accurately as possible. As you type, the response will appear below the target word. When you are finished typing, press the spacebar to submit your response. There are 315 total trials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The second word will only be presented for 1 second. However, you can keep typing after the word has disappeared.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not be able to edit your response. Try to type as quickly and as accurately as possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Usually, the two words presented on a trial will be different words (e.g., 'HOUSE' then 'TRUCK'). Sometimes however, the two words presented on a trial will be the same word.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you press the spacebar to submit your response, the next trial begin immediately.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After 105 trials you will be able to take a short break. There will be 315 trials total.
                        </li>

                        In this example, the second word is "TRUCK". You would type truck as quickly and as accurately as possible then press the spacebar to submit and start the next trial.
