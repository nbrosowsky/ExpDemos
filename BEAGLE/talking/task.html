                    <p>
                        There are two parts to this experiment. In the first, you will to say a word out loud, then, after the word disappears, press the spacebar as quickly as possible (instructions for the second will be given once you've completed the first).
                    </p>
                    <p> On every trial you'll see two words presented briefly, one after the other. The first will be presented in green font, the second word will be presented in red font. Your task is to say the <strong>second</strong> word (the red word) out loud. The second word will only be presented for 1 second. After the word disappears, you must press the spacebar as quickly as possible. Responses must be less than 1 second, otherwise you will receive a warning about responding too slow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The second word will only be presented for 1 second. You should say the word as soon as it appears.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After the second word has disappeared, you must press the spacebar as quickly as possible. Responses made before the word disappears will be ignored.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Usually, the two words presented on a trial will be different words (e.g., 'HOUSE' then 'TRUCK'). Sometimes however, the two words presented on a trial will be the same word.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you press the spacebar to submit your response, the next trial begin immediately.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After 30 trials you will be able to take a short break and receive new instructionw. There will be 60 trials total.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        In this example, the second word is "TRUCK". You would say truck out loud as soon as it appears, then press the spacebar after it disappears.
