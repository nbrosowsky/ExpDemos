            <h2>Task Overview</h2>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Time:</strong> This task takes approximately 5 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> You will be compensated $0.50 for completing the hit.</p>
            <p><strong>Task:</strong>There are two parts. In the first, you will be presented with two words in a row. The first will be presented in green font, the second in red font. Your task is to say the second word (out loud), then when it disappears, press the spacebar as quickly as possible (30 trials). In the second, you will make judgments about single words (30 trials) </p>
            <p><strong>Preview:</strong> You can preview this hit by continuing without accepting the hit. </p>
            <p><em>To complete the hit you must accept the hit before continuing.</em> Close the practice window, then accept the hit on the main window to continue.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Part 1:</strong> On every trial you'll see two words presented briefly, one after the other. Your task is to say the <strong>second</strong> word out loud. The second word will only be presented for 1 second. After the word disappears, you must press the spacebar as quickly as possible. Responses must be less than 1 second, otherwise you will receive a warning about responding too slow.
            </p>
            <p> For example: </p>
            <p><img src="images/example.png" width="75%" />
            </p>
            <p>Once you submit your response (by pressing spacebar) you will automatically proceed to the next trial.</p>
            <p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Once you've completed the first part (30 trials), you will receive instructions about the second part, where you will make judgments about single words (30 trials). You will receive more instructions after you've completed the first part.</p>


            <p><strong>This experiment requires a pop-window to be full-screen. At the end of the experiment the window will automatically close and return you to amazon where you can submit the hit.</strong></p>

                <h2><strong>Title:</strong> Cognitive processes in motor control</h2>
                <h2><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Dr. Matthew Crump - Psychology Department</h2>
                <hr>

                <p><strong>Purpose of the Research Study:</strong> The research is being conducted to gain more knowledge about the cognitive processes involved in highly trained skills, such as typing, that require people to rapidly order actions in a goal-directed fashion.</p>

                <p><strong>Procedures:</strong> The experiment will involve one session lasting approximately 20-30 minutes. The specific task may vary and could involved the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Perform typing tasks. Tasks involve being presented with a visual stimulus and making a typing response. The visual stimulus could be a word, a letter, a string of letters, or a picture. You will be required to make a response to the target by using the computer keyboard. Unless instructed otherwise please be as quick and accurate as possible when making responses.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none">
                    <li>
                        <strong><em>*Note that sometimes the backspace or delete key may not function during the task.</em></strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em><strong>**This task is only for people who are fluent in English.</strong></em>
                    </li>
                </ul>




                <p><strong style="display: inline;">Risks/Discomforts:</strong> There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those associated with normal computer use.</p>


                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Although it will not directly benefit you, this study will advance basic science on the cognitive processes involved in motor control. This could lead to better training curriculum for improving skills like typing and playing musical instruments.</p>


                <p><strong>Voluntary participation and right to withdraw:</strong> Participation in this study is voluntary, and you can stop at any time without penalty. To stop, click on the "Return HIT" button, or close your browser window.</p>


                <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> The only identifying information kept based on your participation in this study will be your Amazon Mechanical Turk WorkerID serial number. This is automatically recorded.</p>


                <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive $0.50. Payments are made via Amazon's payment system.</p>

                <p><strong>Questions or Concerns:</strong> You can ask questions about this research study now or any time during the study by e-mailing Nick Brosowsky at

                    <h4>This document serves as short description of the purposes behind our experiment.</h4>
                    <p class="spaceBelow">
                        The general purpose of this study is to investigate how memory is influenced by word-meaning and the semantic relationships between words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the first part of the experiment you completed a simple speaking task. Each target word was preceeded by a context-word that was either the same, similar, or different than the target word. Later, your memory was tested on all the target words. Some work has shown that resolving conflicting information might help memory. Here, we were interested in examining how the relationships between the context and target words helped or hindered your later memory for the target words.
