# task-switching

A well known finding in research on attention and performance is that people suffer costs when switching between two different tasks (Monsell, 2001). Typically, performance is faster and more accurate when you repeat the same task twice in a row, as compared to when you switch between two tasks. This cost to performance in both speed an accuracy is referred to as the task-switch cost.

This experiment is a variation of a typical task-switching paradigm. I used the same design as Stoet, O'Connor, Conner, and Laws (2013), though I did not include the pure versus mixed list manipulation. In their paper, Stoet et al. found that females outperformed males at task-switching (i.e., smaller task-switch costs). Therefore, I also included some basic demographic information at the beginning of the experiment.
